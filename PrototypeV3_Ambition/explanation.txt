This is an ambitious part that will attempt to integrate both 2D and 3D aspect when possible
2D would be simulation map while 3D would visualize the changes in the rack
Whether or not this will work is beyond me...
Hopefully it would be achievable before UTS and UAS, but with current workload of work and college it may be difficult...
